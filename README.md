# LetterCase App 
reads `input.txt`, converts its letter case according to a key press (1/2/3), writes the result to `output.txt`, and opens it in Notepad.
1. Convert words to Capitalized.
2. Convert every chars to lowercase.
3. Convert every chars to UPPERCASE.

## Run
1. Put your text into `input.txt` next to `letterCase.exe`.
2. Run exe.
4. The result will save in `output.txt`.

## Files
- `letterCase.py` — main Python script.
- `input.txt` — input file (place your text here; must be in the same directory as the script).
- `output.txt` — generated output file (created/overwritten by the script).
